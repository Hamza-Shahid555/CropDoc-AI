CropDoc: Plant Disease Detection using ResNet-9CropDoc is an intelligent agricultural diagnostic system designed to identify 38 different plant diseases through image analysis.
By leveraging a custom ResNet-9 architecture, this project provides a high-accuracy, computationally efficient solution for real-time crop health monitoring.
🏗️ Model ArchitectureThe architecture is specifically designed to handle $256 \times 256$ RGB images, utilizing residual learning to ensure deep feature extraction without
the risk of vanishing gradients.StageOperationsOutput ShapeInputRGB Image(3, 256, 256)Conv Block 1Conv (3 $\rightarrow$ 64), BatchNorm, ReLU(64, 256, 256)Conv Block 2Conv
